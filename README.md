CTA3 2024 - CS4 GST Practice Case Study

Summary:

Background:
- Power Australia Pty Limited (Power) is considering acquiring Solar Store Pty Limited (SStore) for $45 million. Initially the acquisition was planned to be through purchasing shares in SStore.
- Power's Board is re-evaluating the acquisition structure potentially shifting to acquiring assets rather than shares.
- SStore's assets are held in subsidiaries: Asset Pty Ltd (Asset) for physical assets and Secret Pty Ltd (Secret) for intellectual property.

Late Breaking Facts:
- As of 15 May 2024 the acquisition has not been completed.
- Power's Board is now contemplating acquiring the assets of SStore including those held by Asset and Secret instead of acquiring shares.

Questions:
1. GST-Free Going Concern: Can Battery acquire the assets of SStore Asset and Secret as a GST-free going concern?
2. GST Treatment if Not GST-Free: What is the GST treatment if the acquisition cannot be treated as a GST-free going concern?
3. ITC and RITC Claims: How will the change in transaction structure affect the eligibility to claim ITCs and RITCs on incurred costs including Accumin’s Clover’s and CarneRock’s expenses?

Suggested Solutions:
1. GST-Free Going Concern:
   - Battery can acquire the assets of SStore Asset and Secret as a GST-free going concern if all necessary components for continued operation are transferred and each supply meets the GST-free criteria.

2. GST Treatment if Not GST-Free:
   - If the acquisition cannot be treated as a GST-free going concern it will be considered a taxable supply.

3. ITC and RITC Claims:
   - Battery: Can now claim ITCs on acquisitions related to the asset purchase since it will be a fully creditable purpose.
   - Power’s Expenses: Adjustments may be necessary if the use of previously acquired services changes due to the revised structure. Specific advice:
     - Accumin’s Structuring Advice: No change in ITC/RITC recovery.
     - Accumin’s Financial Modelling and Due Diligence: ITCs fully recoverable; advice applicable to the asset acquisition.
     - Clover’s Legal Due Diligence: ITCs fully recoverable; advice applicable to the asset acquisition.
     - Clover’s Share Purchase Agreement Drafting: ITCs not recoverable; specific to share acquisition.
     - CarneRock’s Success Fee: Partial reapportionment possible; impact depends on services provided.
   - FAT Model: Generally not recalculated for prior periods; adjustments affect future periods.
